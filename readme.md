## Booing Application

Booing is a new green, secure, and decentralized cloud service that recycles wasted space containing useless files and the energy of connected devices. It offers the user the opportunity to rent a part of the recovered space, paying in tokens that can be converted into traditional currency.

## Description about the Booing App

The worldwide demand for the cloud, a virtual space for data storage, is growing with revenues exceeding 444 billion dollars in 2022. A turnover that could reach around 1,000 billion dollars by 2027, with an average annual growth rate of +17.7%. But to "feed" the clouds, chips are materially needed, which are the basis of any electronic device, from smartphones to new connected cars, which is why, in this historical era, they are struggling to support the enormous global demand; among the reasons for the shortage of chips, there is also the difficulty in finding the raw material, such as silicon, which must be extracted from mines, with increasingly less sustainable practices.

...it should be added that clouds are digital archives, indispensable in the age of streaming, but they need large quantities of electricity to cool the servers they are made of. And again, the clouds keep ever more frequently files and data, which have no real use or whose usefulness runs out at the time of use itself, such as memes, funny videos, gifs, for example, yet these data "eat up" space that it could be used for something else. It should also be considered that the increasingly frequent hacker attacks could, if well orchestrated, bring the cloud market to its knees and with it the data of millions of companies and billions of people.

For all these reasons and in a scenario of this type, aggravated by the increasingly delicate international situation, the Nevil company is launching Booing on the market, a new green, secure and decentralized cloud service, able to intelligently recover space, buy a starts directly from the user and giving anyone the opportunity to archive their files on connected and distributed devices, so that the files will always remain available, indelible and unassailable. Booing is the first truly green cloud because, while all the companies that offer cloud services continuously purchase new space and use large quantities of energy to cool and maintain the servers, Booing recycles space and energy, which in any case would have been used to keep the device on guest, recycling space occupied by useless files, thanks to sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms, with a huge impact on the environment, recovering as much space as possible, without however affecting important files.

Booing offers the user the possibility of renting a part of the recovered space, paying it in tokens, which can be transformed into traditional currency without going through complicated procedures which are currently the prerogative of cryptocurrency geeks only.

In essence Booing represents a real revolution in the cloud computing market capable of assisting the need to have more and more space available and to consume less energy with a specific focus on security

- safe: once a file is uploaded to booing, it is fragmented into millions of pieces which are in turn copied 7 times and saved on different devices, in this way the files are always available and inaccessible from the outside

- green: Booing recycles wasted space to contain useless files and the energy with which each of us recharges the phone or keeps his PC online, in this way not even 1 GB will be wasted, in addition to the fact that the data center is 100% % eco-friendly.

- convenient: Booing pays the user for a part of the space that Booing manages to recover, in this way the user will always have the optimized device and money in his wallet. The Premium version of Booing also has a much lower price than other providers.
